### Hi, I'm Michael Fagan

I am a data scientist working at VectorNorth, working primarily in computer vision. My academic background is mostly mathematics, with an MSc in Mathematics from George Mason University and a dual major BSc in Physics and Mathematics from Virginia Tech. Before VectorNorth, I was a machine learning scientist at BlackHorse Solutions, where I worked on projects like:
- Confidence estimation for neural network predictions
- Implementing contrastive loss functions for self-supervised pretraining
- Containerization and deployment of models
- A full-stack internal research project where I worked on everything from literature review and data pipelining, to modeling, analysis, and presentation of results

I work heavily with deep learning, but I have experience with more classical models as well. I love broadening my horizons with new models, techniques, and tools, and I'm always looking to learn something new either for or alongside my current projects.

If you're interested in me and my work, reach out to me at mfagan12@gmail.com!
